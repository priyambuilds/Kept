// What "back" goes to (D-86). Every forward navigation goes through planStack, which rewrites the root
// stack so back never walks into a finished flow:
// - Passing screens (signing, checking, outcomes, moments, sheets) are never left behind the next screen.
// - When a flow reaches an outcome, its steps go too: after "Oath created", back is not C6 … C1.
//   Outcomes that offer "try again" (rejected, failed, invalid code…) keep the steps, so the retry is there.
// - Flows that make something new (create, join, Rematch, a Bounty) land on home, not on where they started
//   (a broken Oath, an error, someone's profile): that context is stale once the new thing exists.
// - A screen that's already in the stack (same route, same id) is gone back to, not opened twice.
// Tab destinations (B1–B4, D0, H1, I1) are handled by the caller: back to the existing home, nothing above.
